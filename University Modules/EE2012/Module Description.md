# Analytical Methods in Electrical and Computer Engineering

This module covers the mathematical fundamentals of probability theory and complex variables which are necessary in the study of integrated circuits, 
communications, communication networks, control systems, signal processing, energy and new media. There is a strong emphasis on the application of 
these concepts to electrical and computer engineering problems, such as the Gaussian distribution in communications, random variable distributions 
for system reliability, complex integral theorem and complex integral formulas.
