# Text-based RPG

This is my first project that I completed in NUS (during the semester break of my second year).

This program is a simple text-based role-playing game (RPG). 
First of all, it introduces a scenario to the user in the terminal. 
It also asks the user for an input decision at periodic intervals.
I have included the general steps that I took to built the program, as well as additional challenges (some of which I have implemented).
These are commented in story.py.

To run the program, ensure that all three files: story.py, battle.py and characters.py are in the same folder.
Then run story.py on an IDE.
The user will input his/her commands in the terminal.
The instructions for the game itself should be self-explanatory (although it might require a few tries for some of the inputs).

I welcome you to play this simple RPG before looking through the lines of code. Have fun!
