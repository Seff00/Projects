# Text-based RPG

This is my first coding project that I completed in NUS (during the semester break internship of my second year).

This program is a straightforward text-based role-playing game (RPG). It starts off by presenting a scenario to the user in the terminal. At various intervals, the user is also prompted to make a decision. I've listed the general steps I took to create the program in story.py, as well as with some additional challenges and features (some of which I have implemented).

Ensure that story.py, battle.py, and characters.py are all located in the same directory. Next, launch an IDE and run story.py. The user will type their inputs into the terminal. The game's instructions should be self-explanatory (although some of the input decisions might require a few tries).

Enjoy the game and hope you have fun!
