Holiday Projects

My first project completed during my semester break while I was studying in NUS.

This is a simple text-based RPG game where the program outputs a scenario and asks the user for an input decision at periodic intervals.
I have included the general steps that I took to built the program, as well as additional challenges that I may or may not have implemented.
These are commented out in story.py.

To run the program, ensure that all three files: story.py, battle.py and characters.py are in the same folder.
Then run story.py on an IDE.
The user will input his/her commands in the terminal.
The instructions for the game itself should be self-explanatory (although it might require a few tries for some of the inputs).
